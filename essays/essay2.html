          <h1>The Digital Silencing of Palestinian Voices: How geopolitics & Digital Coloniality Play a Role in Internet Censorship</h1>
          <p>
            The ushering in of the digital age and the Internet has
            fundamentally changed the state of global communication and
            interaction. This rapid growth in interconnectedness is not neutral,
            because of the largely centralized and controlled by large
            corporations it is profoundly influenced by geopolitical dynamics
            and often times perpetuates forms of “digital coloniality”, which is
            when dominant powers control digital spheres in order to reinforce
            existing inequalities and narratives. The widespread censorship of
            current affairs and news content related to the Palestinian
            situation (genocide) on platforms like Tik Tok is a compelling case
            study. It illustrates how online platforms can become tools in
            international conflicts, aiding to silence marginalized voices and
            controlling global perceptions. This essay explores how the
            internet, geopolitics and digital coloniality intersect through Tik
            Toks content moderation concerning the Palestinian conflict
            (genocide).
          </p>
          <p>
            As the conflict in Gaza escalated and reached worldwide audiences in
            2024, Palestinian voices across social media platforms experienced a
            surge in digital repression (El Houri, 2025). A report from Sada
            Social, a palestinian digital rights organisation, brings light to a
            troubling truth, documenting over 25, 000 violations against
            Palestinian digital content across major social platforms including
            Tik Tok in 2024 (El Houri, 2025). Tik Tok accounted for 27 percent
            of these instances (El Houri, 2025, p.3). These violations came in
            the form of “content takedowns, shadow banning, account suspensions,
            and other forms of algorithmic suppression” (El houri, 2025, p.2).
            Users reported the restrictions of posts sharing footage from Gaza,
            mourning martyrs, or expressing political solidarity, with some even
            being “locked out of their accounts entirely” (El Houri, 2025, p.2).
            The censorship went beyond images of the massacres to include
            content related to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, a
            palestinian politician, and protests with anti-occupation slogans
            such as “Death to Israel” and “Death to America”, thereby hindering
            the work of media organisations and violating core principles of
            press freedom (El Houri, 2025, p.5)
          </p>
          <p>
            The geopolitical underpinnings of TikTok’s censorship are evident in
            the discourse that surrounded the potential ban in the United States
            in 2024 and its subsequent ban in 2025. While the ban was publicly
            framed as a national security concern due to its Chinese ownership,
            congressional insiders and Israeli officials revealed a link to
            concerns about Israel’s public image (MEE staff, 2025). US Senator
            Mark Warner and former Congressman Mike Gallagher, who introduced
            the bill against TikTok disclosed that the legislation ‘gained legs
            again’ after October 7th, when ‘people started to see a bunch of
            anti semitic content the platform’ (MEE staff, 2025, p.284). Ken
            Klippenstein, an independent journalist, reported that Israeli
            officials and lobbyists explicitly informed Washington insiders
            about Tik Tok’s significant influence on young Americans' views of
            Israel (MEE staff, 2025, p. 285). This perception directly played in
            role in influencing US lawmakers, with figures such as Mitt Romney
            expressing ‘overwhelming support for us to shut down potentially Tik
            Tok’ due to the ‘disproportionately high number of mentions of
            Palestinians on the platform relative to other social media sites’
            (MEE staff, 2025, p.287). Nikki Haley even went as far as to suggest
            that users merely engaging with content on Tik Tok could make them
            antisemitic (MEE staff, 2025, p. 287). This demonstrates how
            geopolitical interests can directly influence decisions regarding
            online content moderation and platform availability, transforming
            digital spaces into crucial battlegrounds for narrative control.
          </p>
          <p>
            The silencing of Palestinian voices on platforms such as TikTok and
            other social media, serves as a stark example of digital
            coloniality, where dominant powers impose control over the flow of
            digital data (Fatafta, 2023; Rajagopal,2023). This control is a
            reflection of existing offline power imbalances (El Houri, 2025;
            Robinson et al., 2015). Sada Social’s report highlights how content
            moderation "disproportionately disfavoured and silenced
            Arabic-language political speech, which are influenced by post-9/11
            ‘war on terror’ policies (Fatafta, 2023, p.21). There is a
            significant double standard- while Palestinian content is often
            censored, the report noted that there was an ‘unchecked spread of
            hate speech and incitement against Palestinians’, often by Israeli
            accounts, including ‘explicit calls for genocide’ (El Houri, 2025,
            p6). There is a stark contrast between the response to the
            Palestinian situation (genocide) vs. the war on Ukraine, where rules
            where ‘bent’ and citizens where allowed to express ‘resistance and
            fury’ against invaders, including calls for violence. These
            privileges were not extended to Palestinians (Fatafta, 2023, p.
            23-24). The reliance on automated content moderation tools, which
            have been poorly trained in Arabic and incorrectly deleted
            nonviolent Arabic content 77% of the time, further demonstrates
            systemic bias and unfairness (Fatafta, 2023, p26). Issues like
            Al-Aqsa Mosque being labelled a terrorist organisation or
            Palestinian terrorists’ underscore these systemic failures (Fatafta,
            2023, p27). The digital repression of Palestinians is not confined
            to specific geographies, indicating a systemic global effort (El
            houri, 2025, p.9). The broader concept of digital inequality
            suggests that groups that are already subject to inequalities
            offline often experience less internet usage and face barriers when
            it comes to effective digital engagement, which amplifies their
            disadvantage in conflict contexts by limiting their ability to
            document human rights abuses and share their stories( Robinson et
            al., 2015, p. 140). The theoretical understanding of the internet’s
            impact on geographic location as discussed in the sources, further
            illuminates the inherent complexities of digital spaces (Greenstein
            et al., 2018). The internet reduces three key interrelated economic
            frictions; communication costs, transportation costs, and search
            costs (Greenstein et al., 2018, p. 38). This initially gives the
            impression that there has been a leveling of the playing field
            (Greenstein et al. 2018, p. 43). However it is becoming increasingly
            evident that online platforms are not neutral (El Houri, 2025, p.
            10). Instead, in contexts of conflict, “algorithms, reporting
            mechanisms, and moderation practices become part of the conflict
            itself” (El Houri, 2025, p.10). This demonstrates that while the
            internet theoretically fosters greater connectivity and information
            sharing, in practice, it can be leveraged to reinforce existing
            power imbalances and inequalities. The selective enforcement of
            content policies as seen with Tik Tok and other platforms when it
            comes to the Palestinian case provides evidence that the “death of
            distance” model is “too simplistic” (Greenstein et al., 2018, p.
            81). Offline differences and geopolitical interests significantly
            mediate how digital technology shapes information access and
            expression (Greenstein et al., 2018, p. 81).
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, the case of TikToks censorship of Palestinian content
            strikingly demonstrates the intersections between the internet,
            geopolitics, and digital coloniality. Online platforms are far from
            being neutral carriers of information, and are often deeply embedded
            in global power dynamics, their content moderation policies and
            algorithmic biases reflecting and reinforcing geopolitical
            interests. The digital erasure of Palestinian narratives, including
            documentation of alleged war crimes illustrates a tangible form of
            digital coloniality, where the dominant narrative is systemically
            enforced. The intentional silencing is often influenced and fueled
            by powerful corporate interests, which ultimately limits global
            understanding and exacerbates existing inequalities by denying
            marginalized communities their right to digital expression and
            documentation, As the digital landscape continues evolve,
            understanding these complex interplays is crucial for advocating for
            genuine rights and fostering a more equitable and inclusive global
            information environment.
