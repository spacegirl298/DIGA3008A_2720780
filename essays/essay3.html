              Reflection of My Website: Structure, Design, and Development
              Insights
            </h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Developing my website has been an iterative process that
              highlighted the deep connection between structure, design and
              functionality. What began as a basic site with disorganised files
              and isolated styling evolved into a well-organised, maintainable
              and user-friendly project. Through continuous feedback and
              testing, I refined each aspect of the website, from its folder
              structure and semantic HTML to its responsive design and
              interactive features. This reflection explores how each element of
              the site was implemented, the rationale behind key decisions and
              how design decisions ultimately influenced the underlying code. By
              examining the site through the lenses of structure, semantics,
              metadata, CSS, JavaScript and UI/UX integration, I am to show the
              technical growth and decision making behind the final product.
            </p>
            <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
            <p>
              Initially, my website had a messy file structure, with each html
              page linked to its own CSS file. This approach was inefficient and
              made maintenance difficult. After receiving feedback, I
              restructured my files to reflect the hierarchical architecture of
              my website, ensuring clarity and easy navigation for both users
              and me as a developer. My folder structure now mirrors the
              websites content, with designated folders for Blogs, Design,
              Essays, Portfolio, and HomeImages. This logical grouping improves
              navigation and maintainability. Each folder contains relevant
              HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, ensuring a clean division between
              sections. This separation enhances readability and makes debugging
              easier. As part of the restructuring, I consolidated redundant CSS
              files into a single blog.css, merging shared styles for the
              Design, Essays, and Blog sections since they used similar layout.
              This reduced repetition and simplified maintenance. I also updated
              my naming conventions by adopting camelCase naming, ensuring
              consistency across all file and class names.
            </p>
            <h2>Semantic Markup</h2>
            <p>
              My website demonstrates a thoughtful use of semantic HTML,
              employing elements like header, main, footer, article, and section
              to provide clear structure, while hcard and hentry microformats
              enhance machine readability. These markups are used to improve
              usability by enabling better navigation for search index indexing
              and screen readers. In my design, blogs and essays section writing
              pieces are wrapped in article, indicating self-contained content,
              while section was used for group related content. This improves
              document structure and helps assistive technologies understand
              content hierarchy. Throughout the website I maintain a logical
              heading hierarchy, to improve navigation for screen readers.
            </p>
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>
              With implementing my CSS, I prioritised creating a clean, modular,
              and maintainable codebase while ensuring consistent styling across
              the entire website. I avoided inline styling entirely, relying
              instead on external CSS rules to centralise styling rules. This
              approach not only keeps the HTML clean but also makes it easier to
              update styles globally. For example, I used reusable classes like
              footer-nav and nav-menu to maintain visual consistency for the
              navigation and footer bars. I organised the CSS into logical
              sections split it across files based on functionality. Such as,
              portfolio.css for the portfolio page, which has different styling
              to other pages. I attempted at responsive design, but having media
              queries which adapt layout for mobile devices.
            </p>
            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
              Reflecting on the JavaScript implementation for my website, I can
              see how each feature enhances both functionality and user
              experience. The back-to-top scroll, ID smooth scrolling and mobile
              friendly hamburger menu all rely on event listeners and DOM
              manipulation to create intuitive interaction points. The animated
              transitions between blog posts add a polish feel, while the
              lightbox for my portfolio ensures a clean, focused viewing
              experience. One of my favourite features is the automatic
              light/dark mode switch based on South African time, which uses an
              API to adjust the theme from 6am to 6pm and vice versa. Combined
              with the live clock in the navigation bar, it personalises the
              site for local visitors. If I expand this project further, I’d
              explore more async requests to minimise reloading data and improve
              performance.
            </p>
            <h2>UI & UX Impacting Code</h2>
            <p>
              Through designing and coding my website, I see how deeply design
              choices shape the code. The different themes, hover animations and
              responsive layouts create an immersive experience, but they also
              demand careful CSS structuring and JavaScript coordination. For
              instance, the lightbox gallery’s smooth transitions and navigation
              arrows work well visually, but they rely on tightly coupled JS and
              CSS, making future updates tricky. The code which I have written
              for this website focuses on aesthetics and interactivity, but it
              also highlights the trad-offs between visual polish and long-term
              scalability. Moving, forward I’d refactor repetitive styles,
              document UI patterns more clearly, and test more rigorously for
              accessibility to strike a better balance. This project has taught
              that good UI/UX isn’t just about how it looks, it’s about how the
              code behind it adapts and grows.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Building this website taught me the importance of structure,
              organisation, and user experience in web development. By refining
              the folder structure, using semantic HTML, and optimising CSS and
              JavaScript, I improved both functionality and maintainability.
              Features like responsive design, dark/light mode, and smooth
              scrolling enhanced usability, while metadata and microformats
              boosted accessibility and SEO. This project also revealed areas
              for improvement, such as reducing repetitive code and ensuring
              better scalability. Overall, it was a valuable experience that
              strengthened my technical skills and highlighted the need for
              clean, efficient coding practices.
