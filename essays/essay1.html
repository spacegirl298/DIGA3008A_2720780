            <h1>UI & UX ANALYSIS</h1>
            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>
              As South Africa’s largest online retailer, Takealot offers a wide
              variety of products to consumers. (Takealot, 2019) Takealot plays
              a major role in the e-commerce market, and its website needs to
              balance its commercial goals with user experience (UX) and user
              interface (UI) design. Drawing from readings and lecture
              materials, this essay will be an analysis of Takealot’s UI and UX,
              evaluating both its functional effectiveness and its ethical
              implications. This essay argues that while Takealot’s website
              effectively enhances usability and customer engagement, its
              interaction design raises ethical concerns about data privacy,
              manipulative dark patterns, and potential exclusionary design.
            </p>
            <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
            <p>
              Takealot’s website and mobile app serve as the core platform for
              its business operations, as the company relies exclusively on its
              digital storefront for sales and customer engagement. The platform
              offers an extensive product catalogue with a wide range of
              categories, including groceries, fashion, and many others. Once an
              order is placed, customers can choose between home delivery or
              collection from a nearby Takealot pickup point. (Takealot, 2019)
              Takealot was founded in 2011, and its platform has grown
              exponentially since with over 10 million monthly website visits.
              (Statista, n.d.) This growth has been created by the platform’s
              strategic emphasis on rapid delivery services, competitive
              pricing, and the website's user experience and user interface
              design.
            </p>
            <h2>UI DESIGN</h2>
            <p>
              Takealot’s website utilizes UI design principles to optimize
              usability and drive sales. UI refers to the visual and interactive
              elements of a website that enable the user to interact with it.
              (Collins, 2023) The interface features a clean, minimalistic
              layout with intuitive navigation. This section will analyse
              Takealot’s navigation structure, colour palette, web content
              accessibility guidelines and visual hierarchy.
            </p>
            <h3>NAVIGATION DESIGN & PROMOTIONAL ELEMENT</h3>
            <figure>

                alt="screenshot of Takealot's homepage"
              />

            <p>
              The website features a top navigation bar with a search bar,
              category menu, account options, cart and daily deals section. This
              navigation bar is designed to provide quick and easy access to the
              most important areas of the website. The search bar stands out
              through its size and placement, allowing users to quickly locate
              specific products they are interested in. It displays autocomplete
              suggestions of product names, trending searches, or spelling
              corrections to cut down search time and to promote tending items.
              The category menu condenses multiple categories into a single
              button, when the button is clicked on it creates a drop-down menu.
              The drop-down menu avoids cluttering the interface and
              overwhelming users with information. The cart icon uses a
              universally recognized symbol of a cart, allowing users to
              intuitively understand its purpose without needing to learn new
              visual languages. According to Raffee, familiar icons improve user
              experience by providing instant recognition. (Raffee, 2025, pg. 9)
              The cart icon leads the user to a page that displays the products
              a user has selected for purchase, offering a visual summary of
              their shopping activity. The daily deals section is strategically
              placed in the navigation bar to continuously drive sales. Because
              the navigation appears on every page, it ensures that users are
              constantly reminded of current promotions. The website heavily
              promotes sales, as seen in Figure 1 where they are promoting an
              Easter sale. The Easter sale is a large visually striking image
              which takes up the middle of the page, capturing the user’s
              attention. The prominent use of purple against the plain white
              background increases the visual impact, making the promotion an
              obvious focal point. The words “Save” and “55%” are displayed in
              large, bold white text. The use of the word “save” acts as a
              psychological trigger, creating a sense of urgency and excitement.
              Research shows how “discounts tap into our brain’s reward system,
              making us feel pleasure and excitement when we see a good deal.”
              (Wise, 2022) This constant remind of promotions is used as a
              tactic for users to purchase products, but this topic will be
              expanded on more in later parts of this essay.
            </p>
            <h3>COLOUR PALETTE & BRANDING</h3>
            <p>
              In the previous paragraph, the importance of colour in web design
              was discussed. As stated by Raffee in her lecture slides “colour
              plays a vital role in web design, influencing branding, user
              experience, and visual hierarchy.” (Raffee, 2025, pg.13)
              Takealot’s website uses a minimalist and consistent colour
              palette, primarily featuring blue (#0077C2), white (#FFFFFF), and
              shades of grey. Blue, the dominant colour in the branding and UI,
              appears in the navigation bar, clickable links, and buttons. It
              conveys trust and loyalty, crucial for an e-commerce platform that
              requires sensitive customer information. White is the main
              background, creating a clean, spacious layout that makes text and
              product images stand out clearly. Shades of grey are used for
              secondary text and borders, maintaining a minimalist aesthetic
              without drawing attention away from key content. Product prices
              are displayed in black, reinforcing their importance in the visual
              hierarchy. Red and green act as accent colours: red highlights
              urgency in sales banners and error messages, while green is
              typically used to indicate positive actions like successful
              transactions. (Wise, 2022) These choices ensure a cohesive design
              that supports branding, enhances user trust and improves
              navigation.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the
              international standards designed to make web content more
              accessible to people with disabilities. (World Wide Web
              Consortium, 2024) These guidelines focus on the content being
              perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Perceivable is
              the first principle that ensures users can perceive and access web
              content. WCAG 2.1 guidelines require non-text content to have text
              alternatives (W3C, 2018). Takealot’s website provides alternative
              text for most of its products, as seen in Figure 2, which provides
              a detailed alternative text for an image of an SSD card. However,
              some of their promotional banners lack descriptive alternative
              texts. Alt text is essential for users relying on screen readers
              and when there is a lack of alternative texts, it can reduce
              accessibility for visually impaired users. The operable principle
              ensures that users can interact with and navigate a website
              effectively, even when just using keyboards, assistive technology,
              or voice commands. (W3C, 2018) The navigation on Takealot is
              keyboard-friendly, but on some dropdown menus, it is difficult to
              navigate without a menu. The third principle is understandable
              which ensures that web content is clear for users with cognitive,
              learning, and language disabilities. This emphasizes the
              importance of readable and predictable content. (W3C, 2018) The
              consistent layout of the website allows users to get used to one
              layout for the website and not have to constantly learn new
              layouts. On certain products, there is a product description that
              avoids complex jargon allowing for many users to understand.
              However, with some products like the one in Figure 3, there is a
              lack of description, leaving users confused and needing to do
              further research. The last principle is robust, which ensures that
              web content is compatible with assistive technologies such as
              voice control, braille displays, and screen readers. (W3C, 2018)
              Takealot has constant updates to ensure that it supports a wide
              range of assistive technologies.
            </p>
            <h2>UX DESIGN</h2>
            <p>
              UX (User Experience) design refers to the process used to create
              meaningful and relevant experiences for users. It focuses on
              understanding user needs, behaviours, and emotions to design
              websites that are functional and accessible. (Interaction Design
              Foundation, 2016) This part of the essay will be analysing the
              user experience of the Takealot website through the different laws
              and effects of UX design.
            </p>
            <h3>LAWS</h3>
            <figure class = "image-container">
              <img

          Restorff effect in the Takealot Website"

              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              This section will explore key psychological principles, such as
              the Von Restorff Effect, Hick’s Law, and the Zeigarnik Effect, and
              how they are implemented within the UX design of the Takealot
              website to enhance user interaction. The Von Restorff Effect
              predicts that an object is most likely going to be remembered when
              it differs from objects that are similar. (Raffee, 2025, pg.3) In
              Figure 4, the users’ eyes are led straight to the “takealot more
              deals” category, as it differs from the categories above it. It
              has a different font, and the red border creates this category to
              be a focal point. As seen in Figure 1, there are many categories
              for the user to go through and it can take quite a bit of time as
              there are so many choices. This leads us to Hick’s law, where the
              amount of time to make a decision is dependent on the number of
              choices provided to the user. (Raffee, 2025, pg. 7) While
              searching through categories and adding products to the cart,
              users are introduced to cart reminders. Cart reminders are sent
              through an email or push notification, to remind users of items
              left in their cart and encourage them to come back and complete
              their purchases. This is known as the Zeigarnik effect which looks
              at how users “remember uncompleted takes better than completed
              tasks.” (Raffee, 2025, pg.9) All these laws are used throughout
              the website to drive engagement and enhance user interaction.
            </p>
            <h2>ETHICS OF INTERACTION DESIGN</h2>
            <p>
              Ethics in interaction design refers to the moral principles that
              guide designers when creating a digital experience. (Mahdy
              Farahany, 2025) This discussion will look at how the interaction
              design of Takealot’s website raises concerns about design justice
              and dark patterns.
            </p>
            <h3>DESIGN JUSTIC PERSPECTIVE</h3>
            <p>
              Through Sasha Costanza-Chock’s reading, “Design Justice,” we will
              be evaluating the concept of design justice within the Takealot
              website. “Design justice rethinks design processes, centers people
              who are normally marginalized by design, and uses collaborative,
              creative practices to address the deepest challenges our
              communities face.” (Sasha Constanza-Chock, 2020, pg.6). This quote
              discusses a way of designing which prioritizes inclusion and
              equity. As discussed in previous parts of the essay, Takealot
              website has created an easy-to-navigate shopping experience for
              many users, through its UX and UI design. However, there is a lack
              of evidence that shows that Takealot’s design is centered around
              marginalized users. Takealot needs to include marginalized users
              in their design process, allowing users to help redesign features.
              As discussed previously in this essay, Takealot is compliant with
              the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, but it is still lacking
              in certain areas. An example is the complex descriptions of
              products, which contain jargon that many users do not understand.
              Costanza-Chock’s reading focuses heavily on prioritizing the
              “design’s impact on the community over the intentions of the
              designer.” (Sasha Constanza-Chock, 2020, pg.6) We can see the
              intentions of the designers to try to make a website that is
              accessible for more users, but the website is so focused on
              profits than helping marginalized communities. Takealot has a
              subscription program called Takealot One, where users pay for a
              monthly or yearly subscription. This gives the benefits of free
              delivery services, priority access, and exclusive discounts. This
              subscription plan excludes users who cannot afford it. It gives
              better discounts and free delivery to users who can afford it.
            </p>
            <h3>DARK PATTERNS PERSPECTIVE</h3>
            <p>
              Through the website “Dark Patterns at Scale” we will evaluate how
              Takealot uses dark patterns and deceptive design in its website.
              Before diving into this topic we need to understand what dark
              patterns are, the authors of this website describe them as “user
              interface design choices that benefit an online service by
              coercing, steering or deceiving users.” (Mathur et al., 2019) As
              discussed in the previous topic about design justices, Takealot
              has a subscription plan that is easy to opt into but is harder to
              unsubscribe from. This is a characteristic of a hard-to-cancel
              pattern, where canceling a Takealot One subscription involves
              several steps that can be hard to understand, making it a
              challenging process for some users. Takealot contains a hidden
              cost dark pattern where some fees or delivery costs are only
              revealed later in the checkout process. This tactic is used so
              that users can spend the extra money, as they are excited about
              the products they are about to purchase. Takealot also contains a
              Fake scarcity dark pattern, which is when “the user is pressured
              into completing an action because they are presented with a fake
              indication of limited supply or popularity.” (Mathur et al., 2019)
              This tactic is seen throughout the Takealot’s website where they
              have text stating “Only 3 left!” or “Limited time offer!”
            </p>
            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p>
              Takealot’s website demonstrates a strong use of UI and UX design
              principles that contribute to its usability and commercial
              success. Its strategic use of colour and intuitive design all
              contribute to an engaging shopping experience. However, while the
              platform showcases effective design, it brings up some ethical
              issues. Issues such as limited accessibility for marginalized
              users, the use of manipulative dark patterns, and the
              prioritization of profit over community-centered design. This
              analysis highlights that while Takealot succeeds in creating an
              efficient digital marketplace, it needs to address ethical issues
              to create a more inclusive user experience.
