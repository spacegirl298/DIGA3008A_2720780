          <h2>Goal Alignment</h2>
          <p>
            My goal is to create a portfolio website that strikes a thoughtful
            balance between readability, creativity, and aesthetic appeal to
            deliver an engaging and professional user experience. I aim to
            prioritize legible typography, well-structured content, and
            intuitive navigation to ensure accessibility and clarity. The design
            will reflect my personal aesthetic through cohesive color schemes,
            balanced layouts, and carefully selected interactive
            elements—enhancing visual interest without overwhelming the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website will serve as a professional representation of who I am
            as both a creative and a designer. It is tailored to attract
            potential employers and clients within the art, game design, and web
            development industries. By showcasing my drawings, paintings, games,
            logo designs, and web development process, the site will function as
            a comprehensive portfolio that highlights my skills, creativity, and
            professional identity.
          </p>
          <h2>Content Mapping</h2>
          <figure class="landscape">
            <img
              src="./images/contentsDgm.png"
              alt="Diagram of Contents of the website"
              width="450"
              height="300"
            />
            <figcaption>Diagram of Contents of the website</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The website is structured into six main content areas, each serving
            a specific purpose and audience. The About Me section offers a
            personal introduction, providing insight into who I am and sharing
            some of my background and experiences. The Design section is divided
            into three key categories: the IxD Process, which includes goal
            alignment, content mapping, user flow, and explanations of interface
            elements; the Style Process, which explores color schemes,
            typography, composition, and includes a reference list; and
            Wireframes, which presents the structural layout of the site with
            annotated wireframes that highlight interaction points and design
            rationale. The Essays section contains academic writing that
            supports my creative and theoretical approach, while the Blogs
            section features research entries and reflections on my design
            process. Finally, the Portfolios section showcases my creative work
            and is organized into three categories—Games, Animation, and
            Art—providing a comprehensive overview of my skills and artistic
            output.
          </p>
          <h2>User Flow</h2>

          <figure class="landscape">
            <img
              src="./images/userFlow.jpg"
              alt="diagram of user flow "
              width="450"
              height="300"
            />
            <figcaption>Diagram of user flow of website</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The user flow of the website is thoughtfully structured, emphasizing
            intuitive navigation, consistent access, and clear pathways between
            content areas. The Home Page serves as the central navigation hub,
            allowing users to easily access all primary sections of the site:
            About Me, Design Process, Blogs, Essays, and Portfolio. This
            centralized structure helps users orient themselves quickly and move
            seamlessly from one section to another. Additionally, the pages are
            cross-linked, enabling fluid transitions and encouraging deeper
            exploration and engagement throughout the site.
          </p>
          <h2>Explaining Interface Elements</h2>
          <p>
            To ensure that I have a well-structured, visually appealing and
            user-friendly interface that aligns with my goals, I need to focus
            on the interface’s elements.
          </p>
          <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
          <p>
            There is a consistent navigation bar present across all pages of the
            website, providing direct links to the primary sections. This
            consistency facilitates easy navigation and helps users clearly
            understand the site’s structure, enhancing overall usability.
          </p>
          <h3>Back to Top Button</h3>
          <p>
            The button enhances user experience by allowing quick return to the
            top of the page, whcih especially beneficial for pages with
            extensive content, such as the essays, blogs and design pages.
          </p>
          <h3>Footer</h3>
          <p>
            This visually communicates to the user that this is the end of page,
            but also has easily accessible information about me, such as my
            LinkedIn profile and Itch page.
          </p>
          <h3>Buttons</h3>
          <p>
            On the Design and Blog pages, navigation buttons are included to
            help users move between different sections with ease. These buttons
            enhance functionality by providing quick, intuitive access to
            related content, supporting a smoother and more efficient browsing
            experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Breadcrumb Navigation</h3>
          <p>
            The blog page contains breadcrumb navigation which is a secondary
            navigation system that provides links to previous pages without
            having to click the back button. If you are on a certain page, the
            breadcrumb will visually show that you are on that page, by not
            having a link to that page anymore.
          </p>
          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            The website contains an ID tag to the about me page. The about me
            page is located in the middle of the home page. I have added an ID
            tag, which links the user straight to where about me is. This allows
            for users to not get frustrated by being sent to the home page and
            then have to search for the about me. This link is in all
            navigations of the website. With Javascript, there is a smooth
            scroll to the about me section, which adds a satisfying appeal to
            the website.
          </p>
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I have learnt that the IxD process is a very important part of the
            design process. At first I didn't understand the importance of the
            IxD process, until I started coding the CSS for my website. It
            allows for you to plan out your website and to ensure that you are
            creating a website that is user friendly and visually appealing. I
            have also learnt that it is important to focus on the content of the
            website, as this is what will attract users to your website. This
            process has been a great learning experience for me, helping me
            broaden my skills.
