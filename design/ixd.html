          <h2>Goal Alignment</h2>
          <p>
            My goal is to create a balance between readability, creativity and
            aesthetic appeal to provide and engaging user experience. I want to
            prioritize legible typography, well-structured content and intuitive
            navigation. The design will incorporate engaging elements, to bring
            across the aesthetic appeal. I will focus on cohesive colours and
            balanced layouts, allowing for users to not be overwhelmed with
            information and to create a memorable experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Focusing on my goal alignment and the structure of my website, I
            want it to be presented professionally and attract the right
            audiences. My target audience is for potential employers or clients.
            I want people in the art, game design and web development industry
            to view my website as a portfolio of my work. The website will be a
            portfolio showcasing: drawings, paintings, games, my process of
            developing a website, logos and information about me.
          </p>

          <h2>Explaining Interface Elements</h2>
          <p>
            To ensure that I have a well-structured, visually appealing and
            user-friendly interface that aligns with my goals, I need to focus
            on the interfaceâ€™s elements. I will have a sticky navigation bar
            that will be on all pages of the website, this will have links to
            other sections on the website. This will allow for easy
            accessibility of any page. I will have clear categories for all the
            different pages, allowing for users to navigate which ever page of
            the website that their heart desires. In certain parts of the
            website, like the design and blog sections, there will be a
            subnavigation bar where users can access different blogs or
            different subsections of the design process. These sections have
            mass amounts of information, so I separated them into different
            pages. This allows for easy readability, accesbility and a clean
            look.
          </p>
          <p>
            There will be a footer page, which visually communicates to the user
            that this is the end of page, but also has easily accessible
            information about me, such as my LinkedIn profile and Itch page.
          </p>
          <p>
            On certain pages of the website, it will contain buttons which
            directs users actions. On the home page there will be buttons which
            allow viewers to choose a page of the website they would like to
            explore. On the main blogs page, there will be buttons for the
            different blogs which I have written. On the individual essays page,
            there will be a previous and next button, allowing for users to
            click between different writing pieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website will contain breadcrumb navigation which is a secondary
            navigation system that helps users understand their current location
            on the website and it provides links to previous pages without
            having to click the back button. If you are on a certain page, the
            breadcrumb will visually show that you are on that page, by not
            having a link to that page anymore. In the blogs and design page
            there will be a breadcrumb navigation bar, which allows you to look
            at different blogs or different subsections of the design section.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website will contain an ID tag to the about me page. The about
            me page is located in the middle of the home page. I have added an
            ID tag, which links the user straight to where about me is. This
            allows for users to not get frustrated by being sent to the home
            page and then have to search for the about me. This link is in all
            navigations of the website.
          </p>
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I have learnt that the IxD process is a very important part of the
            design process. At first I didn't understand the importance of the
            IxD process, until I started coding the CSS for my website. It
            allows for you to plan out your website and to ensure that you are
            creating a website that is user friendly and visually appealing. I
            have also learnt that it is important to focus on the content of the
            website, as this is what will attract users to your website. This
            process has been a great learning experience for me, helping me
            broaden my skills.
