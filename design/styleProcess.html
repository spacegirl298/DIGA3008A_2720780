        <h2>Defining Visual Aesthetic</h3>
        <p>
          The website features a clean and minimalist aesthetic with a distinctly vintage 
          undertone, conveyed through a rich, moody color palette of blacks, dark reds, greys,
           and whites. This combination creates a dramatic yet refined backdrop that enhances 
           the sculptural imagery showcased throughout the site. The layout is straightforward and
            gallery-like, allowing the art and writing pieces to stand out without visual distraction. Typography and
             interface elements are kept simple and unobtrusive, reinforcing the minimalist approach
              while complementing the site's classic, slightly nostalgic atmosphere.
        </p>
        <h2>Fonts</h2>
        <figure class = "landscape">
          <img

          />
          <figcaption>Fonts for website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
         The combination of Cinzel, Cormorant Garamond, and Roboto creates 
         a harmonious typographic blend that balances classic elegance with 
         modern clarity. Cinzel brings a bold, sculptural presence to headings,
          Cormorant Garamond adds refined, vintage warmth to supporting text, 
          and Roboto ensures clean, easy readability for navigation and body content.
           Together, they reinforce the website’s artistic and minimalist vintage 
           aesthetic while maintaining strong usability.
           Together, these fonts respect web typography best practices by
            creating a clear hierarchy: Cinzel commands attention, Cormorant 
            Garamond enriches with personality, and Roboto ensures usability and
             accessibility. This layered approach enhances both the aesthetic appeal and 
             functionality of the website, helping users navigate content easily while enjoying a visually cohesive experience.
          </p>
        <h2>Colour Scheme</h2>
        <h3>Primary Palette</h3>
        <figure class = "image">

          />
          <figcaption>Secondary palette for website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Colour Analysis</h3>
        <p>
         The primary palette of the website contains black (#000000), deep burgundy (#470b10), and w
         hite (#ffffff), it creates a bold and sophisticated look. The high contrast between black 
         and white ensures clear readability and clean design, while the rich burgundy adds warmth 
         and depth, serving as a striking accent color. Together, these colors balance elegance with emotional intensity,
          making the site feel vintage, professional, and inviting without overwhelming the user.

          </p>
          <p>
         The deep red (#750011) adds emphasis and draws user attention with its passionate tone. The soft gray (#b7b7b7)
          is applied to navigation bars and borders for links, providing a subtle, neutral contrast that keeps the
           interface clean and easy to navigate without competing with the primary colors. This balance helps create a
            clear visual hierarchy and smooth user experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Composition</h2>
        <p>
         The visual hierarchy of the website is established through a clear and intentional use of typography. 
         Each page begins with a large, centered headline in the Cinzel font, immediately drawing the viewer’s attention. 
         This bold typographic choice sets the tone and indicates the primary message or theme of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beneath the main heading, subheadings appear in a slightly smaller size, using the Cormorant Garamond font, and
          are distinguished by underlining. This creates a strong secondary level of importance that is easy to recognize.
          Sub-subheadings use the Roboto font, styled in both italics and bold, to provide additional emphasis while maintaining 
          a consistent visual language. The main body text also uses Roboto, offering readability and a modern, clean appearance 
          that complements the more decorative fonts used for headings.
        </p>
        <p>
          This progression helps users intuitively understand the structure of information. The eyes naturally gravitate toward 
          the largest elements first, then move downward through the page, guided by changes in font size, style, and weight. 
          This layered approach to typography enhances the user experience by visually signaling the relative importance of each piece of content.
        </p>
        <h2>Interface elements</h2>
        <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
        <p>
         Originally, my website featured a light grey navigation bar with black text, which created a strong contrast against the dark background 
         and suited the modern, boxy aesthetic of the overall design. However, when I decided to shift the website’s visual direction to a more 
         vintage and creative style, I updated the navigation bar to reflect this change. I replaced the clean, minimal lines with a more
          decorative, fancy line to mark the end of the navigation bar, adding a touch of character and aligning with the new aesthetic.
           Additionally, I changed the font to one that better fits the creative and nostalgic feel of the site, ensuring that the navigation 
           bar not only remained functional but also became a cohesive part of the website’s new identity.
        </p>
        <h3>Footer Page</h3>

        <p>
         I updated the footer by replacing the text links with icons to create a cleaner and more visually appealing design.
          Using icons improves the user experience by making navigation quicker and more intuitive, as users can easily
           recognize familiar symbols. This also saves space, making the footer less cluttered while maintaining full functionality.
            Overall, the switch to icons enhances both the aesthetics and usability of the footer.

        </p>
        <h2>Reference material</h2>
        <figure class = "landscape">
          <img
            src="./images/website3.png"
            alt="Screenshot of Steve Mengin Website"
          />
          <figcaption>Screenshot of Steve Mengin Website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>
          I like the dark thematic feel of Steven Mengin’s website. The
          background of the website is black, and there are pops of colour in
          the images. I will incorporate this into my website, but I would want
          to add more colour, in text and in icons. In this website, you have
          cursor which changes into an arrow when you hover over images,
          allowing you to switch between images. I like the idea of adding in
          creative elements and I will explore adding more creative elements
          like this. At the footer of the website, if you hover certain texts,
          the background image changes. This is creative idea, which I will
          implement into the website, as it aligns with my goal of creativity.
        </p>
        <figure class = "landscape">
          <img
            src="./images/website2.png"
            alt="Screenshot of Thieb website"
            width="350"
            height="200"
          />
          <figcaption>Screenshot of Thieb website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>
          In this website, it continues with the dark aesthetic and pops of
          colour which I want to incorporate into my website. As you are
          scrolling through the website, the text and images fade onto the
          screen. This is something I would like to add to my website, it is
          creative. When the text fades in, its stays static allowing for users
          to read the information. This creates a balance between creativity and
          readability.
        </p>
        <figure class = "landscape">
          <img
            src="./images/website1.png"
            alt="Screenshot of HabibTea Website"

          <figcaption>Screenshot of HabibTea website</figcaption>
        </figure>
       
        <p>
          I was inspired by the clean and professional look of the website. The
          website contains a lot of creative elements in its art and layout but
          still contains a minimalistic style which doesn’t overwhelm the user
          with information.
        </p>
        <h2>JavaScript Implementation</h2>
        <h3>Portfolio Lightbox</h3>
        <p>
          In my portfolio section, I implemented a lightbox feature to enhance user 
          interaction and provide a more informative experience. By clicking on an image, 
          users can now view a larger version along with additional context and relevant links. 
          This approach allows visitors to explore the work in more detail without navigating away
           from the main page. The lightbox not only improves visual presentation but also offers a
            more engaging and seamless way to access project information directly from the portfolio.
        </p>
        <h3>Back to Top Button</h3>
        <p>
          I added a "Back to Top" button to improve navigation and enhance the user experience on my
           website. This feature allows users to quickly return to the top of the page with a single click, 
           eliminating the need for excessive scrolling, especially on longer pages. It's a simple yet effective 
           usability enhancement that helps prevent user frustration and keeps the browsing experience smooth and efficient.
        </p>
        <h3>About Me Scroll</h3>
        <p>
          In my homepage, the About Me section is centrally positioned to ensure it's easily accessible and 
          highlights key personal and professional details. To improve navigation and user experience, I added 
          a smooth scroll transition that activates when users click the About Me link. This feature guides 
          visitors directly to the section in an intuitive and visually appealing way, creating a more seamless 
          and engaging browsing experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Fades Between Blogs</h3>
        <p>
          In the blogs section of my site, I incorporated a short fade transition to create a smoother and more visually 
          appealing user experience. This subtle effect occurs when navigating between different blog entries, helping 
          to reduce the abruptness of content changes. The fade transition enhances the overall flow of the site, making 
          it feel more polished and engaging while maintaining a professional and user-friendly interface.
        </p>
        <h3>Hamburger Menu in Blogs</h3>
        <p>
          On the blogs page, I implemented a hamburger menu to improve navigation and user experience. This 
          menu can be easily opened and closed, providing quick access to all blog entries without cluttering the main 
          interface. It helps keep the page clean and organized, especially on smaller screens, while ensuring users can
           seamlessly browse through the available content. The functionality supports a responsive design, making the blog
            section more accessible and user-friendly.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Cursor Change</h3>
        <p>
          I attempted to implement a cursor change effect when users hover over certain portfolio pieces to improve the 
          interactivity and give clear visual feedback. However, despite trying various methods, the cursor style didn’t change as expected. 
          Although the functionality didn’t work, the effort reflects my intention to enhance user experience by making 
          interactive elements more noticeable.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Creating this style guide was a challenging yet deeply rewarding experience. Initially,
           I felt that my website didn’t truly reflect who I am as a person. I wasn’t proud of it,
            and I realized it wasn’t something I wanted people in the industry to see. That prompted 
            me to completely rethink and redesign the site to create a look and feel that felt authentic to me,
             something I could proudly showcase.
          </p>
          <p>
         I began by brainstorming the overall aesthetic, focusing on balancing creativity with readability
          to ensure the website would engage visitors while remaining professional. I explored various design 
          elements, including color palettes, typography, and layout options. This process involved refining my
           ideas until I found a style that genuinely represented me and aligned with my goals for the site.
          </p>
          <p>
          Through this journey, I learned the importance of being flexible and open to iteration. Seeing the
           website come alive in a real environment gave me better insight into spacing, alignment, and how 
           different components interact visually. Ultimately, this process pushed me to adapt my style guide 
           to meet practical needs without losing sight of my original vision. The result is a website that feels 
           truly mine, one I’m proud to present to the world.
