        <h2>Defining Visual Aesthetic</h3>
        <p>
          My website will showcase a sleek, modern and immersive look using
          dark tones for the background. There will be pastel colours which contrast 
          against the dark background. This contrast of
          colours, will enhance readability, ensuring that the text and UI
          remains clear. This use of the colour palate showcases creativity, as the
          dark background will allow for the colourful visuals to stand out.
          This will allow for my portfolio work to stand out.
        </p>
        <h2>Fonts</h2>
        <figure class = "image">

            width="300"
            height="150"
          />
          <figcaption>Fonts for website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The fonts selected for my website are chosen with readability and user 
          experience in mind. For main headings, I’ve used Footlight MT Light, which 
          features elegant, thin letterforms. This font brings a classic, 
          professional feel while adding a creative edge through its subtle curves.
          </p>
        <p>
          For sub-headings, I selected Palatino Linotype which 
           strikes a balance between modernity and tradition. It is slightly simpler 
           than the main heading font, creating a clear visual distinction between 
           hierarchy levels.
          </p>
        <p>
          For body text, I chose Aptos (Body), a highly legible sans-serif typeface. 
          Its clean structure ensures effortless reading, which is essential since 
          the body text carries the bulk of the content. The simplicity of Aptos 
          helps prevent user fatigue, especially during longer reading sessions, 
          and supports overall accessibility and ease of use.
        </p>
        <h2>Colour Scheme</h2>
        <h3>Primary Palette</h3>
        <figure class = "image">

            height="270"
          />
          <figcaption>Old Secondary palette for website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Colour Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          The primary palette of the website consists of pastel greens
          and blues, chosen to reflect the brand's calm, creative idenity. 
          These soft tones promote a clean and approachable aesthetic while
          avoiding harsh visual contrast. The dark blue background serves as
           a stable foundation, creating strong contrast with the lighter
            pastel elements, improving readability and making content stand 
            out clearly.
          </p>
          <p>
          Initially, a secondary pallate was included; however, it visually
           competed with the rest of the design. I chose to remove it to 
           maintain consistency and avoid distracting the user. Too many colors
            can confuse users or draw attention away from important elements. 
            By refining the palette, users are guided more intuitively through
             the site, improving both focus and the overall user experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Composition</h2>
        <p>
          The composition of my website will focus on clarity, engagement and
          creative flow. The website will contain whitespace to reduce clutter, 
          give users room to process information
          and make elements stand out against the dark background. Avoiding clutter, 
          helps guisde the users attention to what matters most. To create a
          visual hierarchy, headings will be large to stand out compared to text
          and images. Different headings have different fonts and sizes, visually 
          showing to the user the different levels of the hierarchy. 
          There will be adequate spacing in between text to ensure
          readability. This is especially needed on longer pages, particularly on mobile
          device to make the experiences feel more breathable.
        </p>
        <h2>Interface elements</h2>
        <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
        <figure class = "image">
          <img
            src="./images/navigation.png"
            alt="navigation bar example, where it looks like a ribbon with text on it"
            width="500"
            height="100"
          />
          <figcaption>Navigation bar example</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-bhewg "
            class="url"
            target="_blank"
            >https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-bhewg
          </a>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          The navigation bar will contain a light grey colour with black text,
          which will create a contrast from the dark background of the website.
          The navigation will reach across the top of the page. If the user is on  
          a certain page in the website, its heading in the navigation bar will be
           highlighted in a different colour, visually showing the user which page 
           they are on. The image above shows my original idea for the navigation bar, 
           where it looks like a ribbon with text on it. However, I decided to go with a more
          minimalistic look, where the navigation bar is a simple rectangle with text on it.
        </p>
        <h3>Footer Page</h3>

        <p>
          The footer page will be a light grey colour, like the navigation bar,
          creating visual harmony between the start and end of the page. When
          users click on the links, it will take them to different wesbites
           depending on the link they clicked on.
        </p>
        <h3>Buttons</h3>
        <p>
          The buttons will have a rectangular boarder with rounded edges. The
          boarder is added to visualize that this is interactable. When users
          hover over buttons they will slightly increase in size, visualizing
          the button is interactable.
        </p>

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I like the dark thematic feel of Steven Mengin’s website. The
          background of the website is black, and there are pops of colour in
          the images. I will incorporate this into my website, but I would want
          to add more colour, in text and in icons. In this website, you have
          cursor which changes into an arrow when you hover over images,
          allowing you to switch between images. I like the idea of adding in
          creative elements and I will explore adding more creative elements
          like this. At the footer of the website, if you hover certain texts,
          the background image changes. This is creative idea, which I will
          implement into the website, as it aligns with my goal of creativity.
        </p>

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In this website, it continues with the dark aesthetic and pops of
          colour which I want to incorporate into my website. As you are
          scrolling through the website, the text and images fade onto the
          screen. This is something I would like to add to my website, it is
          creative. When the text fades in, its stays static allowing for users
          to read the information. This creates a balance between creativity and
          readability.

        </p>
        <p>
          I was inspired by the clean and professional look of the website. The
          website contains a lot of creative elements in its art and layout but
          still contains a minimalistic style which doesn’t overwhelm the user
          with information.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Creating this style guide was a challenging yet rewarding experience.
           I started by brainstorming the overall look and feel I wanted for my website, 
           focusing on balancing creativity and readability. I explored various design
          elements, including colour palettes, fonts, and layout options. The process
          involved refining my ideas to ensure they aligned with my goals of creating
            an engaging and user-friendly interface.
          </p>
          <p>
          However, once I began coding the CSS and bringing the design to life, I quickly
           realised that not everything translated visually the way I had initially imagined. 
           For instance, the navigation bar was originally intended to appear as a ribbon 
           element across the top of the page. While this concept looked appealing in the 
           initial mock-ups, it didn't appear as clean or structured when coded. As a result, 
           I opted for a more minimal and centered navigation layout that better complemented 
           the rest of the site’s clean and modern composition.
          </p>
          <p>
          This experience taught me the importance of flexibility when transitioning from design
           to development. Seeing the site in a real browser environment helped me better understand 
           spacing, alignment, and how different components interact visually. The iterative nature 
           of web design encouraged me to adapt my style guide to suit the practical needs of the
            website, without losing sight of my original vision.
