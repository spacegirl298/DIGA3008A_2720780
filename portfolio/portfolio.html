                <p class="">  In Pizza Eats, the dice are in charge — literally! This 2D
                  roll-and-write computer game flips the script, putting your fate
                  (and your pizza) in the hands of the dice. Each round, three numbers
                  are rolled, and it’s up to you to use them wisely: pick your
                  toppings, choose a slice, and move across the map to deliver your
                  delicious creation. Strategize your moves, fill out your pizza, and
                  race against your opponent to be the first to deliver hot, fresh
                  slices to every house on the block. The first player to complete all
                  deliveries wins — but with the dice calling the shots, anything can
                  happen!</p>

                  In Broken Bonds, step into the stitched shoes of a once-beloved
                  teddy bear, torn from your rightful owner by a troubled brother and
                  locked away in a room that feels more like a prison. From your
                  small, plush perspective, navigate a first-person journey through
                  shadows and memories as you search for a way out. Solve
                  environmental puzzles and push your limits to return to the one who
                  needs you most. But even once you find your way back, the journey
                  isn’t over — you’ll need to mend your broken arm.

            <p class="">
              This painting of the neanderthal is apart of a mixed-media
              installation exploring the tension and intersection between science
              and spirituality. One panel features an acrylic painting of a
              Neanderthal on glass, while another displays a pencil drawing of
              Jesus. The third side, made of plain glass, acts as a visual
              threshold. When viewed from different angles, the installation
              isolates each worldview: one side highlighting religious devotion,
              the other focusing on human evolution. But when standing at the
              midpoint between science and faith, both figures come into focus, a
              deliberate invitation to consider the coexistence of belief systems.

            Layers of Feeling is a portrait of a girl whose face is covered in
            thick, expressive paint — red, yellow, and green — each color
            symbolizing a distinct emotion: anger, happiness, and disgust. As
            the colors blend and bleed into one another, they form new,
            ambiguous shades that speak to the complexity of emotional
            experience. This painting captures the sensation of being
            overwhelmed, when emotions collide, overlap, and become difficult to
            separate.

            desire.
