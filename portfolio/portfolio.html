              The dice are in charge — literally! This 2D
                  roll-and-write computer game flips the script, putting your fate
                  (and your pizza) in the hands of the dice. Each round, three numbers
                  are rolled, and it’s up to you to use them wisely: pick your
                  toppings, choose a slice, and move across the map to deliver your
                  delicious creation. Strategize your moves, fill out your pizza, and
                  race against your opponent to be the first to deliver hot, fresh
                  slices to every house on the block. The first player to complete all
                  deliveries wins — but with the dice calling the shots, anything can
                  happen!"

              Neanderthal on glass, while another displays a pencil drawing of
              Jesus. The third side, made of plain glass, acts as a visual
              threshold. When viewed from different angles, the installation
              isolates each worldview: one side highlighting religious devotion,
              the other focusing on human evolution. But when standing at the
              midpoint between science and faith, both figures come into focus, a
