        <h2>Designing a Moral Web: Toward an Ethical Internet</h2>
        <p>
          My idea of an ethical internet is a space that fosters inclusivity,
          responsibility, genuine connection and does not harm or exclude users.
          This blog will be an exploration of my ideas of an ethical internet
          and will be drawing from Shani Orgad’s reading, The internet as a
          moral space: the legacy of Roger Silverstone, to further explore the
          ideas of an ethical internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          One concept that Shani Orgad mentions in his reading, is Roger
          Silverstone’s idea of “proper distance” (Orgad, 2007, pg. 34). This
          idea encourages finding a right balance between closeness and
          detachment in online interactions to foster moral responsibility.
          Creating it to be space where users are neither so distance that they
          ignore other’s humanity or so close that they exploit or overwhelm
          other users. Currently, many social media platforms prioritize
          engagement at all costs, which amplifies polarization and outrage.
          Social media platforms could design algorithms that prioritize
          meaningful dialogue over sensationalism. This would help people
          connect better and reduce arguments and division. Platforms could
          introduce controlled exposure to diverse perspective, to not overwhelm
          users, but to humanize. By redesigning algorithms, we can reduce
          polarization and encourage empathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The internet is a space where many can feel like they are in an
          inhospitable environment. As Silverstone notes, the “click of a mouse”
          can exclude voices that don’t conform (Orgad, 2007, pg. 38). The way
          that the internet has been designed has allowed for people to have
          freedom of speech, but within this freedom of speech users have been
          ostracized for speaking up. This creates an environment where many
          users, especially those from minority groups, feel unwelcome, unsafe,
          or silenced. My vision of an ethical internet actively uplifts
          marginalized voices instead of silencing them. This could be done
          through changing algorithms, creating safe spaces and holding people
          accountable. Algorithms could be altered to boost underrepresented
          perspectives rather than promoting only viral content. An AI could be
          created to detect harassment towards a user and limit visibility of
          these replies. There should be a hate speech filter, which allows
          users to filter these comments without silencing debates. Users should
          be held accountable for comments which they leave on peoples posts and
          platforms should be held accountable for allowing hate speech and
          bullying to occur within their platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social media has created users to be obsessed with metrics (likes,
          follows, view counts), creating a toxic environment where users
          increasingly equate these numbers to their personal worth. By removing
          these metrics while still slowing users to follow accounts and see
          content, platforms could break this harmful cycle. Without these
          numbers, users might more authentically, focusing on meaningful
          interactions rather than performance metrics. This approach would
          remove the psychological pressure to constantly measure up to
          benchmarks.
        </p>
        <p>
          An ethical internet must prioritize the safety of its most vulnerable
          users which are children. While platforms impose age restrictions,
          these measures are often ineffective, as young users easily bypass
          them, exposing themselves to predators and harmful content. Platforms
          must prioritize safety over engagement, ensuring protection for
          minors. Orgad mentions the internet functioning as a “mediapolis,”
          which is an ethical internet that has a duty of care to all users,
          especially the most vulnerable. (Orgad, 2007, pg. 33).
        </p>
        <p>
          In reimagining an ethical internet, we need to move beyond current
          platforms that reward exclusion and superficial interactions. We need
          to create a digital space that is rooted in empathy, responsibility,
          and inclusivity. To create an ethical internet, means to intentionally
          design and rethink algorithms, revaluate platform priorities, and
          actively protect and amplify marginalised voices.
