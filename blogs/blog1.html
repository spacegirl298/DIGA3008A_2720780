        <h1>My First Push: Setting Up GitHub & Pages</h1>
        <div class="e-content">
      
          <h2>Experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages</h2>
          
          <p>
            Setting up my new repository for GitHub was easy, as I gained that
            skill through lots of practice last year. Publishing to Pages was a
            new experience, but I didn’t find it too difficult. It is something
            that I will need to practice, so that I am not reliant on slides for
            this process.
          </p>

          <h2>Reflections on readings – relating to my experiences today</h2>
          <p>
            Simon Harpers reading, ‘‘As we May Think’ at 65,’ was an eye-opening
            read. He discussed the relevance of Vannevar Bush’s ideas to this
            day. What stood out to me was Bush’s ideas on the mind’s associative
            nature. Bush believed that information should be organized to
            reflect human cognition. In today’s time there is an overwhelming
            amount of information out there, but it is organised in such a way
            that it is not so overwhelming, and our brains can recognise the
            links between everything. I see that today’s web reflects his ideas
            of associative linking and personalization, but it also focuses a
            lot on algorithms and profit, which steps away from Bush’s ideas. It
            was interesting how Bush did not embrace technology but focused more
            on the philosophy of humanity’s relationships with knowledge.
            Harpers reading helped me understand Bush’s ideas and how it shaped
            the the web. (Harper, 2010, pg. 1-3) Interesting things I have found
            about the history of the web I was drawn to Jay’s reading, ‘Flash
            And Its History On The Web,’ (The History of the Web, 2017) as I
            used to be an avid user of Flash. It is interesting to read about
            the journey of this platform and how it came to its end. I was a
            user during the end of its period, so I got the more polished
            version of Flash, but it was truly heartbreaking when I wasn’t
            allowed to use it again. Seeing the evolution of Flash, opens your
            eyes to the constant change of technology and companies. Many
            companies and users were drawn to Flash, as it had many features
            which had never been seen before. But then bigger and arguably
            better companies bought out these features, like Google buying
            YouTube. Flash was such a big hit for its 10 years, but once
            companies found better ways, Flash started hitting its decline. Its
            fascinating to see Jay Hoffmann’s timeline of ‘The History of The
            Web.’ (The History of the Web, 2024) This timeline highlights key
            developments in the web’s history. Mobiles evolution is something
            that stood out to me in this timeline. Phones is an object that we
            all use in our everyday lives, seeing its evolution over time, just
            shows how much can change in 10 years. The first launch of the
            iPhone was in 2007, which evolved so rapidly. Where in 2017 the web
            was accessible on mobiles. This accessibility and portability can be
            linked back to Bush’s ideas of making information accessible
            whenever and wherever.

          <h2>Goals for this course</h2>
          <p>
            My goal for this course is mostly to gain as much knowledge as I
            can. Interactive Media is something very new to me, unless we count
            the knowledge that CAT gave me in high school.
