        <h2>Reimagining the Internet - Without Leaving Anyone Behind</h2>
        <div class="e-content">
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            This blog will be a critical reflection on Sheena Magenya’s reading,
            “Making a Feminist in Africa: Why the Internet Needs African
            Feminists and Feminism.” The article challenges the myth of the
            internet being a neutral and safe space and exposes how it mirrors
            the same inequalities that people fight offline, such as exclusion
            violence and systematic bias, particularly from African feminists.
          </p>
          <h3>The Internet isn't Neutral</h3>
          <p>
            Magenya points out that just because activism moves online these
            days doesn’t mean everyone gets an equal voice. During the COVID-19
            pandemic, many African women, queer people, and disabled communities
            were left out in online meetings such as Zoom and faced online
            abuse. Having access to the internet is not enough, being heard on
            the internet is what is important. Our society is developing from
            old ways of thinking, but some of these mindsets are still instilled
            into our societies. It can be seen when the internet favours
            ‘powerful voices,’ usually white, male, and straight. By employing
            African feminists, they can make a change to this, where they aren’t
            just sharing content, but they are shifting power. Giving space to
            African women, feminists or queer individuals gives a voice to
            marginalized communities, allowing for people to share their stories
            and find communities.
          </p>
          <h3>Africa as a Tech Lab vs a Tech Creator</h3>
          <p>
            One of Magneya’s strongest arguments in this reading is how Africa
            is often seen as a place that receives technology and doesn’t create
            it. When Western society is developing tech for African countries,
            their focus is on solving problems like hunger or disease, but they
            ignore innovation for fun or creativity. African technology should
            be used as a tool to educate individuals about the vast cultures and
            introduce a creative and fun element to it. This matches what
            Chimamanda Adichie calls the “danger of a single story.” (Magenya,
            2020, pg.5) Magenya states in the reading that “we do not innovate
            for fun.” Whenever a story about Africa pops up on my social media,
            it is full of sad stories, but where are the posts celebrating
            feminist creators or our rich culture? The internet hides these
            stories unless you search for them.
          </p>
          <h3>A Feminist Internet</h3>
          <p>
            What stays with me is Magenya’s vision of a feminist internet as a
            place for “more African women, more sexuality and diversity, more
            glitter and ochre.” She wants to focus on the safety of these
            individuals and to allow joy and freedom. This allows for a space
            where for example a gay man can do a makeup tutorial or a disabled
            woman can talk about sex, without receiving hate.
          </p>
          <h3>Critiques</h3>
          <p>
            Magenya’s reading centres on African feminist voices in reshaping
            the internet, it overlooks some contradictions. The piece critiques
            digital inequality but doesn’t fully address how material barriers
            (such as unreliable electricity or expensive data) limit feminist
            resistance in practice.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            This article made me think about my own online habits. How does my
            own privilege (like having access to the internet) keep me from
            seeing others' struggles? Magenya calls not only for big
            organizations but for all of us to demand an internet where “access”
            means more than just connections; it means power. A feminist
            internet isn’t a dream, it’s a necessity.
