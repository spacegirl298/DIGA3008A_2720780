          <h2>Blossoming a Brand: The Blossom Beauty Style Guide</h2>
         
        <h3>Style Guide for Blossom Beauty</h3>
        <p>
          In class we were given 1 hour and 45 minutes and a prompt to create a
          style guide for a website. My group was given the prompt "Blossom
          Beauty - A South African skincare and fragrance brand specializing in
          natural products made from indigenous botanicals like rooibos, marula,
          and baobab. Their eco-conscious approach blends traditional healing
          ingredients with modern skincare science."
        </p>
        <h4>Design Goal</h4>
        <p>
          Our website will showcase a minimalistic, clean aesthetic that
          prioritizes a user-friendly and engaging experience, that is easily
          navigatable. The website will display the products, through reflecting
          the richness of South Africa’s landscape.
        </p>
        <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
        <p>
          We are committed to offer a naturally derived, ethically sourced, and
          sustainably produced skin care and fragrance products. Made with the
          purest ingredients, upholding the highest ethical standards.
        </p>
        <h4>Audience</h4>
        <p>
          Our website will target eco-conscious consumers and wellness
          enthusiasts, who embrace the benefits of organic ingredients.
        </p>
        <h4>Defining Visual Aesthetic</h4>
        <p>
          Our website will exhibit a minimalistic aesthetic, showcasing Blossom
          Beauty’s products, in a manner that is appeasing and easy to the eye.
          The focus of the website is to emphasize the organic ingredients of
          the products, which will attract our target audience. Our minimalistic
          colour palate will create an emphasis on the products to encapsulate
          their natural origin. These colours will be seen throughout the page,
          to create consistency, which will not overwhelm the user with change
          of colour aesthetic.
        </p>
       
        <h4>Colour Scheme</h4>
        <div class = "wireframe-gallery">
        <figure class = "image">
          <img
            src="./images/colorPlt.jpg"
            alt="Colour Pallate for website"
            width="300"
            height="400"
          />
          <figcaption>Colour Pallate for the website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          The website contains a neutral background which will emphasise the
          text and products, as there will be a contrast between the light
          background and dark text. With the use of different colours for
          boarders and headings, it leads the viewers eyes through the website,
          without distracting them. We chose a colour pallate with a variety of
          greens and browns, to match the natural aspect of the product. We
          decided to go with a pastel colour pallate to give a soft and clean
          look to the website, matching the products which are skin care and
          fragrances.
        </p>
        <h4>Fonts</h4>
        <div class = "wireframe-gallery">
        <figure class = "image">
          <img src = "./images/fonts.jpg" alt = "Fonts for website" /> 
          <figcaption>Fonts for the website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          We chose these fonts for a minimalistic look, which doesn't the
          distract the viewer from looking at the fonts. The fonts that we chose
          are easily readable, which allows for effortless reading.
        </p>
        <h4>Layout</h4>
        <p>
          The layout of the website will focus on simplicity and content
          prioritization. Headers and boarders will be used to separate content,
          creating visual clarity. The website will be laid out to draw the
          viewers attention to the product and not get distracted by the design
          of the website. The images of the product will all be the same size,
          allowing for visual consistency.
        </p>
        <h4>Navigation Bar</h4>
        <p>
          The website will contain a navigation bar, which allows the user to
          easily navigate across the website. The navigation bar will contain
          links to: Home Page, Fragrance Section, Skin Care Section, Latest
          Products and a Cart of the products that you have purchased. Within
          the Fragrance and Skin care section there will have a search bar,
          allowing users to search products which they desire to look at. There
          will be a drop-down box which will allow users to categorise the
          products, such as: Price, Latest Products and size.
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          Creating this style guide was quite stressful given the time limit. We
          started off discussing what we want the website to look like and what
          we wanted to acheive with the website. We then split into two groups,
          one group focused on the visual aestheic, while the other started with
          the documentation. Our main focus, was to highlight the products.
          After receiving feedback from one of the tutors, we realised we
          focused so much on the natural aspect of the product, rather than the
          actaul products. We didn't add any orange colours for the rooibos
          products. We should have also added more creative fonts, to add an
          elegant touch to the website.
