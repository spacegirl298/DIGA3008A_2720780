        <h2>Close Readig of Spyros Kasapis's Reading</h2>
        <div class="e-content">
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            In Spyros Kasapis article, “Internet access is a Fundamental Right,”
            he argues that internet access is not a merely a modern convenience
            but an essential human right, especially when bringing in the topic
            of the Covid-19 pandemic. Global lockdowns forced people to migrate
            their daily activities, and this digital divide highlighted
            structural inequality. This blog will be a close reading of
            Kasapis’s article, critically examining his aims, methodology, key
            arguments and conclusion, while situating his argument within
            broader discussions about digital inclusion and the responsibilities
            of governments and corporations in ensuring access to technology.
          </p>
          <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
          <p>
            Kasapis’s text argues that access to the internet should be
            considered a basic human right, he discusses how the COVID-19
            pandemic highlights these inequalities. He compares internet access
            to other recognised rights (such as education, healthcare and
            employment), which increasingly depend on digital connectivity. He
            emphasizes that the pandemic has intensified people’s dependence on
            technology, which excludes people from education and access to
            critical information, due to their lack of access to technology or
            the internet. He critiques the capitalistic structures that create
            and deepen this digital divide and call for an equitable digital
            society governed by fair rules.
          </p>
          <h3>Aims</h3>
          <p>
            The primary aim of the article is to argue that access to the
            internet should be recognised as a basic human right in this digital
            age. He states in his reading that “half the planet does not have
            equal access to education, health (through digital information) and
            the labor market.” (Kasapis, 2020, pg. 2) This raises concerns about
            how the lack of internet access reinforces existing inequalities and
            limits people to fully participate in society. He aims to examine
            these issues specifically in the context of times of crisis, like
            the COVID-19 pandemic. He seeks to raise awareness about the digital
            divide and push for political and social change.
          </p>
          <h3>Methodology</h3>
          <p>
            Kasapis took a philosophical and normative approach to write this
            article, where he combines critiquing socio-politics and moral
            reasoning.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              His argument is grounded in concepts of fairness, justice and
              human rights. “Lack of food, education, health care and fair
              working conditions are obstacles to achieving happiness.
              Therefore, all of the above are – like happiness- human rights.”
              (Kasapis, 2020, pg. 2) This quote is an example of Kasapis using
              ethical argumentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kasapis uses rhetorical questions in his reading, to encourage
              internal and governmental reflection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kasapis uses context from the real world, such as the COVID-19
              pandemic. This allows the reader to relate to the topic, as we all
              experienced the struggles of the pandemic, but it also gives a
              perspective to other people’s lives during the pandemic. This
              opens readers eyes to their privilege as most didn’t experience
              these issues. His articles demonstrate how global crises reveals
              the need for internet access.
            </li>
            <li>
              He critiques the inequality in access and control. He discusses
              how the rich keep getting wealthier, while half of the world
              population don’t have access to this wealth and power. This is a
              critique of power and capitalism.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Structure</h3>
          <p>Introduction:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              He opens this article by linking happiness to human rights and
              introduces the topic of internet access.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Body:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              He introduces the topic of the COVID-19 pandemic, to discuss how
              internet access is tied to social participation and survival.
            </li>
            <li>
              He shifts to critique structural inequality, where our
              capitalistic society has been set up to enrich some and exclude
              most from the digital world.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Conlusion:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The article does not end with a usual conclusion but ends with
              rhetorical question which push readers to reflect on their moral
              and political responsibility.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Key Argument and Results</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              His central argument is that internet access is not a privilege it
              is a fundamental human right. He connects it with other essential
              rights such as education, healthcare, and employment.
            </li>
            <li>
              He critiques how the capitalist systems that are emplaced
              concentrate wealth and digital access to a select few, where half
              of the world remains disconnected.
            </li>
            <li>
              He calls for state intervention, where the government needs to
              take moral responsibility. He states that digital access is not
              just a technological issue but a matter of justice.
            </li>
            <li>
              He exposes the digital divide that occurred during the COVID-19
              pandemic, where the lack of internet and digital access heightens
              inequality. He argues that the pandemic became opened people’s
              eyes to how essential digital access is and how important it is
              for participation in society.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kasapis has many key arguments, but he does not necessarily offer
              results. He does not give statistics to his research, but he
              leaves the reader with a message to reflect on. The message is
              that the internet is a basic need, and everyone should have access
              to it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Critical Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Kasapis presents a string argument that internet access should be a
            considered a human right:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              He effectively argues that internet access is essential for
              participating in our modern society. He uses the COVID-19 pandemic
              as an example to further argue his point and to show how the lack
              of internet and digital access deepens inequality.
            </li>
            <li>
              He raises important ethical questions and challenges readers to
              think about justice, fairness and digital inclusion.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, there is no clear solution offered. He calls for change
              but doesn’t explain how the government or people could
              realistically make a change.
            </li>
            <li>
              The article could have made a stronger argument by adding data
              from different countries and classes. He is very general with his
              argument and doesn’t explore how to work around or with the
              systems that are already emplaced.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Relation to Additional Research</h3>
          <p>United Nations: Internet is Human Right</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The UN declared that internet access is tied to human rights.
              (Francisco, 2012)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The deepening divide – Jan A.G.M. van Dijk</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In Dijk’s article he argues that those with lower income or
              education levels use the internet less effectively, which adds to
              Kasapis’s point that access to the internet alone is not enough,
              there needs to be equal opportunities in the digital space.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Suggestions for Future Research</h3>
          <p>Pre-Covid and Post-Covid</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Researching into the need for internet and digital access before
              and after the access. Studying the difference between the need for
              this access.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Studies on Free Internet Programs</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Researching into countries that have tried to expand access.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Private companies and the role of the government</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
