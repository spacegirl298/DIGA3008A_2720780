                <h4>Pros</h4>
                
                    Navigation bar, which allows the user to navigate through the website.
                    The website contains clear sections of their products. Creating an easier experience for the user to find specific products they are looking for.<br/>
                    At the bottom left of the website there is button with a chat icon. This gives users an opportunity to have a live chat with an employee at Bloomables. When the button is clicked it opens up, revealing a space to chat and contact information of Bloomable’s. Once the user is done with chatting, they can close this icon and navigate through the website without all that information being in the way. This button constantly stays on the screen, allowing for users to access it at any time.<br/>
                
                <h5>Cons</h5>
               
                    Even though it has a navigation bar, it's not a sticky navigation bar. So, users would have to scroll back to the top of the website to navigate through the website.
                    The background colour of the website is white, and the background colours for the products is light cream colours. Creating no emphasis on the products. If they maybe added a blue boarder, like they have done in other sections of the website. It would have created more of an emphasis on the products.
                    There is a change in colour palate. The website starts off with a white background, contrasted with blues and reds. Then when you start scrolling down, you are introduced to pastel colours, and the only pop of colours being the products.

            <h4>Pros</h4>
            <p>
                
                    Sticky navigation bar, allowing users to always navigate main headings at all times.
                    Plain colour palate, allowing a focus on the images. Images intrigues users to read the articles.
               
            </p>
            <h4>Cons</h4>
            <p>
               
                    There is a massive boarder surrounding the website. This boarder is for advertising, it is purple, 
                      creating a huge contrast from the actual website. This bright purple is constantly taking away users attention from the 
                      information as their eyes lead to the brightest thing.
                    There is such an excess of information on the page, so users get overwhelmed not knowing where to start.
