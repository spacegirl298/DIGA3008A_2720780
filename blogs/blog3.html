          <h2>Aligning with Users: My Interaction Design Process</h2>
          <h3>User Alignment</h3>
          <p>
            My goal for my website is for easy readability and to have a lot of
            creative elements. I want the website to be aesthetically pleasing,
            but with an organized clean look. I want to find a balance between
            creativity and readability, where the creativity doesnâ€™t take away
            from the readability. I want this website to be a portfolio of all
            my work and a representation of my abilities in web design. I want
            my users to be able to easily navigate the website. My target
            audience is for people in the web development, game design and
            animation industry. I want to be able to share this portfolio when
            applying for jobs, as it will be a portfolio of all my work. People
            in the industry would wan to be able to easily see my work, without
            unnecessary information being on the website.
          </p>
          <h3>Mapping out of Sites Content</h3>
          <div class = "wireframe-gallery">
          <figure class = "image">
            <img
              src="./images/contentsDg.png"
              alt="Diagram of Contents of the website"
              width="450"
              height="300"
            />
            <figcaption>Diagram of the contents of the website</figcaption>
          </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            The content of the website will be my blogs, art, animations, games
            and describing the website. The most important thing of the website
            is showing all the content in a readable way. The most interesting
            thing of the website will be the creative elements of it. What I
            mean by creative elements, is that the website will be designed with
            colours and different shapes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The actor will start on the contents page, where they will be able
            to see the main page, about me and headings which will link the
            viewer to other content. If the actor goes into the design section,
            they will be able to access information about the IxD process,
            wireframes, final style guide and the style process. If the actor
            goes into blogs, they will see a list of all the blogs which I have
            written, and they will be able to click on a blog heading, which
            will lead them to the blog which they selected. If they go into the
            portfolios section, they will be able to view games, animations and
            art which I have created. In the essays section, the viewer will be
            able to read 2 essays which I have written.

          <h3>User Experience</h3>
          <p>
            The actor will start on the main page, where they will be able to
            scroll down to the About me section and then scroll down to
            headings, which will be Essays, Portfolios, Blogs and Design. Actors
            can click on this heading, which will lead them to other pages.
            Actors are given freedom of choice; in which parts of the website,
            they would like to view. If the viewer goes into the blog section,
            they will be given different choices of which blog they would like
            to view. If the actor clicks on a certain blog, they will be given
            the content of the blog. On the side of the blog will be hyperlinks
            of all the other blogs, which actors can click on at any time. If
            the actor decides to click on the essays section, they will view an
            essay, there will be previous and next buttons allowing the actor to
            navigate between the two essays which I have written. If the viewer
            decides to click on the Design section, they will be introduced with
            4 headings IxD Process, Wireframes, Final Style Guide and Style
            Process. Actors can click on any of these headings, and they will be
            shown information about the heading which they chose. At the top of
            all these pages will be a navigation bar, which will have the
            headings: About Me, Design, Essays, Homepage. Blogs and Portfolios.
            This will allow the actor to go into any section which they desire
            to go into, at any time during the website.
          </p>
          <h3>Interface Elements</h3>
          <p>

            different parts of the website, this will be shown with buttons,
            that will have an image with the heading written below it. In the
            Portfolios section, actors will be able to click on images, such as
            the art and the image will in large. In the blog section there will
            be list boxes, which will allow the actor to click on a certain
            blog. In the Essays section, there will be buttons for the actor to
            navigate between the two essays. The Design section will be the
            exact same as the main page, where there will be buttons with an

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            A good URL scheme improves a website Search Engine Optimization,
            which improves a websites visibility in the search engine. A good
            URL scheme should be descriptive and structured hierarchically, this
            allows for good usability and navigation. With semantic markups,
            allows the content to be meaningful and ensures that it is readable
            to the computer. With the use of sections, headers and articles will
            enhance accessibility and improve SEO.
