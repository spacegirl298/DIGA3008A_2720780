        <h2>Reimagining the Internet - Without Leaving Anyone Behind</h2>
        <div class="e-content">
          <h3>Decolonizing Code</h3>
          <p>
            When writing code, we’re not just creating functional websites, we
            are embedding biases and power structures into the systems that
            shape society. After reading Mohamed and Berhane’s’ readings, it
            forced me to reflect on how my own work could perpetuate
            coloniality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mohamed highlights in his reading, “Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory
            as Sociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence,” how AI
            systems often replicate colonial power structure by centring
            Westerns norms as universal. For example, how facial recognition
            tools are predominantly coded and tested on light-skinned users and
            causes it to fail for darker skin users. (Mohamed et. al, 2020,
            pg.9) This is a design problem rooted in racism and exclusivity. It
            prioritizes a certain group of people and marginalizes a huge
            demographic. To avoid this in my own work, I need to ask myself: Who
            is represented here? I believe there is value in using existing code
            and datasets as resources, but with critical awareness. While using
            available tools, I must actively work to avoid replicating the same
            exclusionary practices prevalent in Western tech.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Birhane’s reading, “Algorithmic Colonization of Africa,” he
            dismantles the myth of neutral AI. He highlights South Africa’s
            Vumacam surveillance system as an example. This system labels Black
            manual labourers as “suspicious” by default (Birhanne, 2020, pg.18).
            Birhane states “how we see the world […] is reflected in the
            algorithmic models we build” (Birhane, 2020, pg.17). Algorithms
            don’t just process data, they encode the biases and worldviews of
            their creators. This forces me to confront my own blind spots as a
            creator. To avoid perpetuating colonial patterns in tech I need to
            document the biases and limitations of my code transparently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mohamed’s concept of “reverse tutelage” (Mohamed et.al, 2020, pg.16)
            fundamentally shifts how we approach the development of technology,
            rather than imposing solutions on communities, we must learn from
            their lived experiences. When developing software for any community,
            I commit to involving community members as equal collaborators in
            decision making, not just as end-users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving forward in my career as a creator I need to recognise that
            decolonising code isn’t about guilt, it’s about accountability. As
            Mohamed urges, we need a “critical technical practice” (Mohamed et.
            al, 2020, pg. 14) that bridges activism and coding. For me, this
            means learning from postcolonial critiques and advocating for
            policies that protect against algorithmic exploitation.
          </p>
          <h3>Incorporating JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            I have not implemented much JavaScript at the moment as I have been
            focusing on redesigning my website, making sure it reflects my
            personality and artistic style, which I feel like my original
            website lacked. I’m slowly implementing JavaScript to enhance the
            experience without overwhelming users. I ma not selectively adding
            subtle interactions to enhance usability. Examples of these
            interactions is smooth scrolling, a progress indictor and a
            back-to-top button.
