          <h2>Mapping Meaning: From Moulthrop to Wireframes</h2>

          <h3>Reflection on Moulthrop's reading</h3>

          <p>
            Moulthrop’s reading examines the promises and failures of hypertext
            as a revolutionary medium. I will be examining how his reflection is
            still relevant to the internet today. Hypertext described by
            Moulthrop is “a technology for creating electronic documents in
            which the user’s access to information is not constrained, by linear
            or hierarchical arrangements.” (Moulthrop, 1991, pg.692) Moulthrop’s
            definition of hypertext is not accurate to todays web as the
            internet is highly structured, which prioritizes engagement over
            exploration. Social media has algorithms emplaced, which decides
            which posts a user sees in their feed. It focuses more on what the
            user has liked in the past, instead of exploring new content.
            Algorithms have also been used to emplace control over users and
            what they view. During the Black Lives Matter Movement in 2020, I
            noticed at first how my feed was filled with videos of protests and
            people bringing awareness to the situation, but over time my feed
            started changing to anything but the movement. I had to go and
            search videos on the movement, because my explore page was being
            filtered. Moulthrop critiqued how hypertext has become dominated by
            “large corporate Web sites.” (Moulthrop, 1991, pg. 691) This very
            much applies to our day and age, as Google, Facebook, Tik Tok, etc.
            have taken over the web. Moulthrop recognised how hypertext could
            serve as liberation or control. Todays internet is both a place for
            activism and a space of surveillance capitalism. Users have freedom
            of speech when it comes to posting freely online, but users are also
            controlled by governments and corporations who can take down posts
            if it is seen as a threat to them. A great example of this control
            was when the US tried to ban Tik Tok in the US during the beginning
            of this year. The reasoning behind the ban was not linked to what
            people were posting, but banning the platform rips away peoples
            freedom of speech on a social network. Moulthrop’s concerns of
            hypertext are still relevant to this day, as the internet has become
            a place of control and influence.

          <h3>Folder Structure and URL Scheme</h3>

          <figure class="image">
            <img
              src="./images/folders.png"
              alt="Folder Structure for HTML"
              width="200"
              height="300"
            />
            <figcaption>
              Screenshot of the folder structure of my HTML
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            I laid out the folder structure into 5 main folders: Portfolio,
            homepage, essays, design and blogs. Within all these folders there
            is an index.html file. Within the Design folder, there is 4 more
            folders: IxD Process, Style Guide, Style Process and wireframes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I separated the 5 main folders, so that each section can have its
            own page, and its not an overwhelming amount of information on a
            page. I subdivided the design folder, because I noticed from
            previous students websites that this section had a huge amount of
            information. So I decided to separate the sections, so viewers don’t
            get overwhelmed with the website.
          </p>
          <h3>Wireframes</h3>
          <figure class="image">
            <img
              src="./images/wf6.png"
              alt="Wireframe for Home Page of Website"
              width="200"
              height="300"
            />
            <figcaption>Wireframe for the Home Page of my website</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Starting off with the homepage, the first thing you would see is the
            title of my website, with images surrounding the title or as a
            background. At the top of the page I would like to have links to all
            the sections in my website, like the portfolio, blogs, essays,
            design and About me. I would like this to be on all the pages of the
            website, so viewers always have access to the different sections. I
            would like the viewer to be able to scroll down from the title, to
            the About me section. This section will have an image of me, and
            information about me like my LinkedIn profile, Itch page, Instagram
            account, etc. Viewers will be able to scroll down some more, where
            they can select the section they would like to go to. As you can see
            in the wireframe, the sections will be represented by an image which
            will correlate to the heading below it. For example the heading
            Essays, will have an image of an essay written on a piece of paper.
            I am still trying to decide if this part is redundant, because at
            the top of the page you can already access the different sections of
            the website.
          </p>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            For the Blog section, I want the page to have multiple rectangular
            blocks above each other. In the block will be a description of the
            blogs details and an image. Viewers will be able to click on the
            block and it will lead the viewer to a new page. This page will
            contain the contents of the blog. On the left hand side viewers will
            be able to see the other blogs, so they don’t have to go back to see
            them.<br />

          <p>
            For the Design Section, the main page will have blocks for the
            different design sections. This will allow viewers to go into the
            section which they would like to view. In the different subsections,
            it is a pretty basic layout, with multiple headings and space for
            content to be placed.
          </p>
          <div class="wireframe-gallery">

            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            In the essay section, it is a pretty basic layout as they are only
            two essays which will be on the website. There will be buttons which
            allow for the viewer to toggle between the two essays.
          </p>
          <div class = "wireframe-gallery">

          <p>
            In the Portfolio Section, this will have 3 different headings:
            games, animations and art. Under games, there will be a photo of the
            game, and a description to the right of it. In the description there
            will be a link to my itch page, so the viewer will be able to access
            the game. Under animations, there will be videos showing animations
            I have created. Under Art will be photos of my art.
          </p>
          <h3>Inspirational websites</h3>
          <p>
            So far, I have only taken inspiration from these following two
            websites. I took a lot of inspiration from the HABIBTEA website
            (Habib, 2024). I like the overall design of the webpage; it is easy
            to navigate, and the design is classy and neat. I took a lot of
            inspiration in the linking between pages. I took inspiration from
            Jenna’s website (Dunford, n.d.), I really liked the way that she
            laid out her blogs, it’s a simple classy look.

          <h3>
            reflection on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to
            you?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Interaction and the www (Geyser, 2025) reflects on the different
            definitions of the word interactivity and how interaction works on
            the www. At first, I agreed with Aaron Smuts definition of
            interactivity, but after some thought I agree more with Lev
            Manovich. “Once an object is represented in a computer, it
            automatically becomes interactive.” (Manovich, pg.55) Interactivity
            is a broad statement, where Aaron states that something is
            interactive when there is a response. I believe you can interact
            with something by just staring at it, you may not be physically
            interacting with it, but you are thinking about it. For example, if
            you put a book on a table and read its contents, reading is an act
            of interacting with the contents of the book. If we look at
            Manovich’s example of an object represented in a computer, makes it
            automatically interactive. As a viewer you are interacting with the
            object, as you are thinking about its shape, size, colour, etc.
