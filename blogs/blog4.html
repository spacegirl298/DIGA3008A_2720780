        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          I truly have been enjoying the process of making my first website. I
          enjoy visualizing how the website is going to look and how it is going
          to work. Learning HTML has had its ups and downs. I always struggle
          with learning something new, as I don’t like that I am not good at
          something when I first start it. I know this is not realistic at all,
          and that’s why I have just been pushing past these thoughts. After
          this internal battle, I have been enjoying the process of learning
          HTML and setting up my website. Through watching tutorials and reading
          through documentation, I have found the beauty in coding in Visual
          Studio Code. I am proud of how my website is looking so far, it
          obviously needs a lot more tweaking, but I am proud of how fast I
          picked up on certain elements. Going forward, I think I want to change
          my original wireframes. I like the overall design, but I created those
          wireframes without a goal in mind. Now that I have a goal in mind, I
          need to alter the wireframes to match this goal. Now that I have gone
          through the design process and style guide, I am more equipped to
          create my wireframes.
